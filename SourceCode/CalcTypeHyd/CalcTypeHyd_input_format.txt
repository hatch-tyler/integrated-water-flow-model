CalcTypeHyd Input File Format
=============================

NOTE: CalcTypeHyd uses list-directed Fortran reads. Comment lines are NOT
supported in the input file. Every line is data.

Line-by-line format:
--------------------

Line 1:  WATER_LEVEL_FILE     Path to simulated water level data file
Line 2:  CLUSTER_WEIGHTS_FILE Path to pre-computed cluster weights file
Line 3:  NCLUS                Number of clusters in the weights file
Line 4:  NCLUSWELLS           Number of wells in the weights file
Line 5:  NHYDRO               Number of type hydrographs to generate

Lines 6..5+NHYDRO:
         CLUSTER_ID           One cluster ID per line (which clusters to generate)

Next 2 lines:
         START_DATE           Start date (MM/DD/YYYY format, read as A10)
         END_DATE             End date (MM/DD/YYYY format, read as A10)

Next line:
         PEST_PARAM_BASE      Base name for PEST parameters (e.g., typ_hyd)

Next line:
         NAVGPER              Number of averaging periods

For each averaging period (3 lines per period):
         NMON                 Number of months in this averaging period
         MON1 MON2 ...        Month numbers (space-separated, NMON values)
         REP_MONTH REP_DAY    Representative month and day for output dates


Averaging Period Example
------------------------

4 averaging periods mapping 12 months:

  Period 1 (Fall):  Months 10, 11, 12 -> represented as 11/15
  Period 2 (Winter): Months 1, 2, 3   -> represented as 02/15
  Period 3 (Spring): Months 4, 5, 6   -> represented as 05/15
  Period 4 (Summer): Months 7, 8, 9   -> represented as 08/15

Months not assigned to any period are skipped during data reading.


Water Level File Format
-----------------------

SMP-style columns (fixed-width):
  Col 1-25:  Well name (A25)
  Col 26-37: Date string (A12), MM/DD/YYYY format
  Col 38-49: Time string (A12), ignored
  Col 50-60: Water level value (A11), parsed as real

First line is a header (skipped).


Cluster Weights File Format
---------------------------

First line is a header (skipped).
Subsequent lines: WELL_NAME  WT_1  WT_2  ...  WT_NCLUS
  - Space/tab delimited
  - NCLUSWELLS data lines
  - NCLUS weight columns per line


Output Files
------------

For each requested cluster, two files are created:
  sim_{weightsbasename}_cls{N}.out  - Type hydrograph values
  sim_{weightsbasename}_cls{N}.ins  - PEST instruction file
